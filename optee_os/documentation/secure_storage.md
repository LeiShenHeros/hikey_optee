# Secure Storage In OP-TEE

## Background

Secure Storage (SST) in OP-TEE is implemented according to what has been defined
in GloblaPlatformâ€™s TEE Internal API specification (here called Trusted
Storage). This specification mandates that it should be possible to store
general-purpose data and key material that guarantees confidentiality and
integrity of the data stored and the atomicity of the operations that modifies
the storage (atomicity here means that either the entire operation completes
successfully or no write is done).

- **[core/tee/tee_svc_storage.c](../core/tee/tee_svc_storage.c):** TEE trusted storage service calls
- **[core/tee/tee_fs.c](../core/tee/tee_fs.c):** TEE file operation interface

- **[core/tee/tee_fs_key_manager.c](../core/tee/tee_fs_key_manager.c):** Key manager
- **[lib/libutee/](../lib/libutee/):** GlobalPlatform Internal API library

### Basic File Operation Flow

When a TA is calling the write function provided by GP Trusted Storage API to
write data to a persistent object, a corresponding syscall implemented in TEE
Trusted Storage Service will be called, which in turn will invoke a series of
TEE file operations to store the data. TEE file system will then encrypt the
data (when CFG_ENC_FS=y) and send REE file operation commands and the encrypted
data to TEE supplicant by a series of RPC messages. TEE supplicant will receive
the messages and store the encrypted data accordingly to the Linux file
system. Reading files are handled in a similar manner.

### GlobalPlatform Trusted Storage Requirement

Below is an excerpt from the specification listing the most vital requirements:

1. The Trusted Storage may be backed by non-secure resources as long as suitable
   cryptographic protection is applied, which MUST be as strong as the means
   used to protect the TEE code and data itself
2. The Trusted Storage MUST be bound to a particular device, which means that it
   MUST be accessible or modifiable only by authorized TAs running in the same
   TEE and on the same device as when the data was created.
3. Ability to hide sensitive key material from the TA itself.
4. Each TA has access to its own storage space that is shared among all the
   instances of that TA but separated from the other TAs.
5. The Trusted Storage must provide a minimum level of protection against
   rollback attacks. It is accepted that the actually physical storage may be in
   an unsecure areas and so is vulnerable to actions from outside of the TEE.
   Typically, an implementation may rely on the REE for that purpose (protection
   level 100) or on hardware assets controlled by the TEE (protection level
   1000).

### TEE File Structure In Linux File System

![TEE File Structure](images/secure_storage/tee_file_structure.png
"TEE file structure in Linux file system")

OP-TEE by default use "/data/tee/" as the secure storage space in Linux
file system. For each TA, OP-TEE use the TA's UUID to create a standalone folder
for it under the secure storage space folder. For a persistent object belonging
to a specific TA, OP-TEE creates a TEE file folder which's name is object-id
under the TA folder.

In a TEE file folder, there is a meta file and several block files. Meta file is
for storing the information of the TEE file which is used by TEE file system to
manage the TEE file; block file is for storing the data of the persistent
object.

If the compile time flag CFG_ENC_FS is set to 'y', the  data stored in block
files will be encrypted, otherwise, the data will not be encrypted. The
information stored in meta file are always encrypted. By default, CFG_ENC_FS is
set to 'y' to keep the confidentiality of TEE files; It is recommended to
change CFG_ENC_FS to 'n' only for TA debugging.

The reason why we store the TEE file content in many small blocks is to
accelerate the file update speed when handling a large file. The block size
(FILE_BLOCK_SIZE) and the maximum number of blocks of a TEE file
(NUM_BLOCKS_PER_FILE) are defined in [core/tee/tee_fs_private.h](../core/tee/tee_fs_private.h).

For now, the default block size is 4KB and the maximum number of blocks of a
TEE file is 1024.

## Key Manager

Key manager is an component in TEE file system, and is responsible for handling
data encryption and decryption and also management of the sensitive key
materials. There are two types of keys used by key manager. One is Secure
Storage Key (SSK) and another one is File Encryption Key (FEK).

### Secure Storage Key (SSK)

SSK is a per-device key and is generated and stored in secure memory when OP-TEE
is booting. SSK is used for protecting FEK, in other words, is used for
encrypting/decrypting FEK.

SSK is derived by:
> SSK = HMAC<sub>SHA256</sub> (HUK, Chip ID || "static string")

The functions to get Hardware Unique Key (HUK) and chip ID depend on platform
implementation.

Currently, in OP-TEE OS we only have a per-device key, SSK, which is used for
secure storage subsystem, but, for the future we might need to create different
per-device keys for different subsystems using the same algorithm as we
generate the SSK; An easy way to generate different per-device keys for
different subsystems is using different static strings to generate the keys.

### File Encryption Key (FEK)

When a new TEE file is created, key manager will generate a new FEK by
PRNG (pesudo random number generator) for the TEE file and store the encrypted
FEK in meta file. FEK is used for encrypting/decrypting the TEE file information
stored in meta file or the data stored in block file.

### Meta Data Encryption Flow

![Meta Data Encryption](images/secure_storage/meta_data_encryption.png
"Meta data encryption")

A new meta IV will be generated by PRNG when a meta data needs to be updated.
The default size of meta IV is defined in
[core/include/tee/tee_fs_key_manager.h](../core/include/tee/tee_fs_key_manager.h)

The data structure of meta data is defined in
[core/tee/tee_fs_private.h](../core/tee/tee_fs_private.h) as follows:

```
struct tee_fs_file_info {
    size_t length;
    uint32_t backup_version_table[NUM_BLOCKS_PER_FILE / 32];
};
```

### Block Data Encryption Flow

![Block Data Encryption](images/secure_storage/block_data_encryption.png
"Block data encryption")

A new block IV will be generated by PRNG when a block data needs to be updated.
The default size of block IV is defined in
[core/include/tee/tee_fs_key_manager.h](../core/include/tee/tee_fs_key_manager.h)

## Atomic Operation

According to GlobalPlatform Trusted Storage requirement of the atomicity, the
following operations should support atomic update:
> Write, Truncate, Rename, Create and Delete

The strategy used in OP-TEE secure storage to guarantee the atomicity is
out-of-place update.

### Out-Of-Place Update

When modifying a meta file or a block file, TEE file system should create a
backup version of the file and then modify it.  For the block file, the backup
version is kept in its filename and in meta data, and for the meta file, the
backup version is only kept in filename.

Naming rule as follows:
```
meta.<backup_version>
block<block_num>.<backup_version>
```

### 3-Stage Update

An atomic operation can be split into three stages as described below:

- **Out-Of-Place update stage**

In this stage, TEE file system will do out-of-place update on the meta file
or the block files to be modified. Any failure occurring at this stage will
cause the operation to fail and no changes will be made.

- **Commit stage**

In this stage, TEE file system will commit the new meta file into Linux file
system and delete the old meta file. Any failure occurring at this stage will
cause the operation to fail and no changes will be made.

- **Clean up stage**

In this stage, TEE file system will clean up unnecessary or old block files.
If an error occurs, the operation still be treated as a success but some
garbage files may be left over in Linux file system.

## Future Work

- **TA storage space isolation**

OP-TEE provides different folders for different TAs in Linux file system for
storing their own TEE files, but OP-TEE cannot prevent an attacker from
directly copying a TEE file from one TA's folder to another TA's folder in
Linux file system. TEE OS should have the ability to detect those kind of
attack, but for now OP-TEE secure storage doesn't meet the requirement.

A simple solution to detect the attack is using TA's UUID as AAD
when calculating the tag of meta file, so that OP-TEE will know if a TEE file
belongs to a specific TA when the TA tries to open the TEE file.

- **TEE file renaming attack detection**

OP-TEE creates a specific folder under the TA's folder for each TEE file in
Linux file system and use the filename of the TEE file as the folder's name.
If an attacker directly rename the name of a TEE file folder, the renamed
TEE file is still a valid TEE file in OP-TEE.

A solution to detect the attack is using TEE filename as AAD when calculating
the tag of meta file.

- **Rollback attack detection**

An attacker can backup each version of a TEE file directly from Linux file
system and can replace the TEE file by an old version one sooner or later.

The basic idea of detecting rollback attack is to add write counter both in
meta file and another storage which has anti-rollback capability such as eMMC
RPMB partition.
